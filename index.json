[{"content":"I lived a lifetime reading Infinite Jest.\nThe book, by David Foster Wallace, is 1,079 pages long. Approximately 100 pages of that are endnotes. No, you can\u0026rsquo;t skip them.\nIt was one of the easiest reading experiences of my life.\nWell, kind of.\nWhen I say I lived a lifetime reading the book, I mean a few things:\nI went through a lot spiritually, emotionally, and mentally during.\nMy first attempt was between my sophomore and junior years of college.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried every summer since 2013.\nSo, yes, I actually finally read it and that was easy and great, but it took almost a decade to get me there.\nA Poor Attempt At Explaining The Plot and Themes Infinite Jest is about addiction. And communication. And capitalism. And grief. And Quebec separatism. And tennis.\nMost of it takes place in Boston at either the elite Enfield Tennis Academy or the Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House. Then there\u0026rsquo;s also some wheelchair assassins talking on a cliff in Arizona. These stories don\u0026rsquo;t really connect at first, but over the course of the novel, they spiral and interweave at an exponential rate.\nIt also takes place in \u0026ldquo;the future\u0026rdquo; (possibly 2008, 2009, or 2011) where time is subsidized by brands and corporations, something has eliminated New England\u0026rsquo;s map for keeps and now it\u0026rsquo;s just the Great Concavity, and people watch TV and movies via InterLace cartridges.\nSpeaking of movies—there\u0026rsquo;s talk of a cartridge that, when viewed, causes a person to become so obsessed and addicted they can\u0026rsquo;t look away and want nothing else in life but to watch it, eventually wasting away and dying. The Quebec separatist wheelchair assassins want this cartridge. And the director of what is called The Entertainment was James Orin Incandenza (father to our main character Hal) who committed suicide before actually finishing or releasing The Entertainment.\nAnd The Entertainment\u0026rsquo;s actual title was, you guessed it:\nInfinite Jest\nInfinite Summer I learned about Infinite Jest when I was in high school I think. That\u0026rsquo;s when I started getting into postmodern literature such as House of Leaves (my favorite book) and experimental or ergodic media in general. I was very into what I as a person in a rural conservative Midwestern/Southern town considered weird, esoteric, \u0026ldquo;underground\u0026rdquo;.\nHowever, I didn\u0026rsquo;t buy the brick until college. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember if I bought it for this specific challenge, but for all intents and purposes, my first real attempt at reading Infinite Jest was inspired by the Infinite Summer challenge. Infinite Summer took place in 2009, from June 21st to September 21st. Around 10 or 11 pages a day, every day. And there were forums and blog posts from guides and guest posts and everything. People like John Green and Colin Meloy even participated.\nI obviously did not participate then. But I heard about Infinite Summer in college, and I decided to follow the schedule.\nIn all the years I\u0026rsquo;ve attempted since then, I usually get about 10 days in before I fall off the wagon so to speak.\nThis time, I bought the eBook. That way, I could read right when I woke up, or during a work break, etc. Way easier than lugging that giant tome around with like 6 bookmarks.\nThere were days I didn\u0026rsquo;t follow the schedule. In particular, I missed a few weeks because my schedule no longer allowed for me to read in the morning. But even though I missed more than two days in a row,1 I always managed to carve out some time to get caught up.\nI also managed to get COVID during the final week, so that freed up a lot of time to read.\nBut Why? Like, why the fuck did I do this?\nPart of me loved the challenge. Like, yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m one of the people who\u0026rsquo;s read Infinite Jest. It\u0026rsquo;s like how I\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a smug asshole about having read Ulysses. And I loved the additional challenge of reading a bit of it every day for an entire season.\nBut then there\u0026rsquo;s the actual experience of reading it. I laughed. I cried. I almost threw up. I was terrified.\nDo not pay attention to the stigma around Infinite Jest, that it\u0026rsquo;s just for pretentious dude douchebags who take women on bad dates or something. Infinite Jest is one of the most earnest books I\u0026rsquo;ve ever read. It has such love and care and compassion for its characters; this is doubly important considering most of our characters are teenage boys or people battling drug and alcohol addiction.\nI was actually a bit surprised by that. I expected an almost Kubrickian sterile perfection. To be fair, some scenes are. But a postmodern ironic masterpiece it is not. At no point when reading did I get the sense DFW was playing with me. Yes, even the whole endnotes thing. Challenging me? Absolutely. But it never felt like he was doing something just to show off or get one over on me.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m glad I didn\u0026rsquo;t approach the book like a problem to be solved.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t annotate or consult a fan wiki or anything like that while reading. I didn\u0026rsquo;t try to figure out what it all meant. I submitted to the author and the text, and I surrendered to the journey they took me on. I let Infinite Jest happen to me. If you decide to read it, I recommend you do the same.\nWhat did I learn? When I read the last sentence, I looked up and said, \u0026ldquo;Oh my god, I finished it,\u0026rdquo; my voice full of awe and disbelief.\nAnd I proceeded to have a transcendental existential experience walking to work. I work in Cambridge, so I walk through Boston and Inman Square and all that every day. The final sentence lingered in my brain for that entire 3.5 miles. I thought about all the things this book made me feel and how I was in the place where it all happened. I was connected to these characters and their lives, as if the network of people in the book now included me.\nIt all felt so mystical—as if I were merging with something divine. Exploring that feeling helped me articulate to myself and to my therapist that I was lacking the spiritual and metaphysical in my life. I haven\u0026rsquo;t meditated or gone to any retreats in a few years. I haven\u0026rsquo;t left the Buddhist path or anything, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the mental capacity for that aspect of my life. I moved, COVID happened, my (now former) relationship spiked my anxiety, work gave me a nervous breakdown, and I had to switch meds every month or so. I can\u0026rsquo;t even keep my house clean, let alone build a meditation habit again.\nReading Infinite Jest, no joke, gave me the space to calm my mind and let wonder and luminosity flow in.\nAnd I learned that I could actually do this. I could finish this very long book that not a lot of people finish, even after trying and failing for almost a decade.\nOn the first page, Hal Incandenza thinks, \u0026ldquo;I am in here.\u0026rdquo;\nHe is in here, inside me, as is the book. And so am I.\nFor habits, it\u0026rsquo;s okay to miss one day. Just don\u0026rsquo;t miss two in a row.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/i-am-in-here-part-1-what-i-learned-from-reading-infinite-jest-in-92-days/","summary":"I lived a lifetime reading Infinite Jest.\nThe book, by David Foster Wallace, is 1,079 pages long.

Sharing my knowledge with others as freely as possible. As of time of writing, I\u0026rsquo;m participating in some \u0026ldquo;learning sprints\u0026rdquo; for queries in Logseq. I actually don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself a Logseq power user or anything, at least compared to the folks who build these complicated dashboards and workflows for every aspect of their lives. I mainly use Logseq for my Zettelkasten; therefore, my needs aren\u0026rsquo;t too complicated.\nI wanted to write this post now because the sprint has me thinking of how I use properties, tags, and links within my Zettelkasten, and how that affects queries. Also, vice versa.\nI hope a walk-through of my setup and workflow is helpful. If you have questions or comments, please reach out to me! My Twitter is linked on the main page of this site.\nAlright, let\u0026rsquo;s get into this.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get on the same page Any time I write about a topic which has commonly misunderstood or slightly variant meanings, I like to explain how I\u0026rsquo;m viewing it. The Zettelkasten as a topic and method means a lot of different things depending on who you talk to about it. Without getting into who\u0026rsquo;s right, who\u0026rsquo;s wrong, gatekeeping, the history, etc. etc., here\u0026rsquo;s how I understand the Zettelkasten.\nZettelkasten German word meaning \u0026ldquo;slip box.\u0026rdquo; These are apparently very common over there. The general method has been around for centuries, but now, we mostly interact with Luhmann\u0026rsquo;s practice. And to be more precise, we\u0026rsquo;re interacting with that mostly through the book How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens.\nA Zettelkasten, either analog or digital, has multiple \u0026ldquo;compartments\u0026rdquo; for different kinds of notes. Usually, there are compartments for reference notes and \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; notes, with the occasional project note, structure note, and so on.\nA person takes whatever \u0026ldquo;fleeting\u0026rdquo; notes made through the day (more on those in a second) and writes \u0026ldquo;permanent\u0026rdquo; notes from them. A person will also create reference notes for sources (like books, articles, movies, and conversations), and they will make notes inspired by/in response to those sources. It\u0026rsquo;s important to connect notes together.\nAs notes accumulate, webs and clusters emerge. Those clusters help inform writing projects and other forms of creative expression.\nThe way I understand and do the Zettelkasten method is focused on developing ideas for writing, not general note-taking, knowledge management, or linked tool environment dashboard system thing.1 If you use it that way and it works, don\u0026rsquo;t let me stop you.\nFleeting Notes Fleeting notes make up most of the notes we take during the day. These are our tasks, random lists, thoughts, and ideas. They are not necessarily meant to be permanent; instead, you review them and see what you can bring into your Zettelkasten.\nPermanent Notes Permanent notes are the notes that make it into the Zettelkasten. At least in the way Ahrens uses the term, a permanent note is not synonymous with a \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; note. All \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; notes (or Zettels as some of us call them) are permanent notes, but so are literature notes.\nPermanent means it stays in your Zettelkasten.\nReference Notes I think Ahrens calls these literature notes. I follow Luhmann\u0026rsquo;s method and reason for making these notes, so at their simplest, they are bibliographic entries in my Zotero database and nothing more. If I\u0026rsquo;m going to take notes on them, I will make highlights, but instead of necessarily rewriting anything in my own words or summarizing what I\u0026rsquo;m reading, I make a simple index. I note the page something is on, I give a brief hint as to what it\u0026rsquo;s about, and then I tag it with a topic I\u0026rsquo;m focused on.\nZettels Zettels are the main part of the Zettelkasten. For me, these are not about rewriting something I\u0026rsquo;ve learned in my own words. Rather, they are for responding to, building on, or otherwise interacting with a source or idea.\nMy digital Zettelkasten Why my setup is so weird Like I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned elsewhere, I do all my Zettelkasten nonsense in the tool Logseq. Logseq is an outliner tool with a focus on the block instead of the page. I see a lot of folks who do Zettelkastens (or Zettelkästen if we\u0026rsquo;re being pedantic) in Logseq leaning heavily into the outliner aspect and nesting blocks for their Zettelkasten structure. I would love to do that! However, I publish my Zettelkasten online via the Logseq plugin which converts public pages to Hugo-compatible markdown. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the nesting approach works well in my use case.\nI also care a lot about the visual representation of my graph database. I promise I\u0026rsquo;m not a person who is obsessed with making their graph visualization look as cool as possible (more power to y\u0026rsquo;all who do). I just like seeing the clusters in my Zettelkasten form, and that visual representation is an easy approach. This means I don\u0026rsquo;t need giant nodes in the network visualization for tags and pages that are acting more like folders than anything. I also don\u0026rsquo;t want to see a lot of connections between notes that aren\u0026rsquo;t in support of the Zettelkasten.\nMy solution is to rely heavily on blocks in my daily journal page. When you insert tags and links in a block, that connection won\u0026rsquo;t be reflected in your graph visualization unless you include journal pages in the settings.\nHow does this fit into PARA? Remember how I did that whole Building a Second Brain thing?2 The organization framework taught in that is called PARA: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.3 Because some folks view the Zettelkasten as another \u0026ldquo;second brain\u0026rdquo; system, they try to \u0026ldquo;PARA\u0026rdquo; their Zettelkasten.\nHowever, while a Zettelkasten can be part of a \u0026ldquo;second brain,\u0026rdquo; it in and of itself is not the same thing, at least not in the way Tiago Forte teaches the second brain. I include my Zettelkasten in the Areas section of my second brain organization because it\u0026rsquo;s something I need to maintain.\nStep 1: Fleeting Notes The first step in my Zettelkasten workflow is taking fleeting notes. As defined above, they\u0026rsquo;re basically any notes I take during the day. Like I said, reminders and tasks are technically fleeting notes.\nIn Logseq, I have a template for the fleeting notes I know will feed into my Zettelkasten. Usually, these are ideas for Zettels.\n- TODO **Note goes here** date:: tags:: type:: [[fleeting]] I work from my daily journal page. I create a block and use the above template. In practice, it looks like this:\nThe reason why Logseq is a great tool for me is that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to create a page for each fleeting note. They can all be blocks, and those blocks can be queried, referred to, and embedded elsewhere.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s go through each aspect of the above fleeting note.\nFirst, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice I have a TODO task marker on it. I don\u0026rsquo;t use Logseq for task management; however, I mark these specific fleeting notes as TODO to remind me that they are actionable. These notes aren\u0026rsquo;t just thoughts. They are something I can grow, and I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t let them slip by.\nNext, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the note has block properties. Instead of doing inline tags or links, I do properties to make querying easier.\nThe first property is the date property. I don\u0026rsquo;t use the Logseq date picker for that or insert a linked date there. I manually type the date in YYYY-MM-DD format. I do this because, when I query my fleeting notes, I can view the results as a table and sort by date. If I were to use the date picker, the format for the above note would be \u0026ldquo;Jul 15th, 2022.\u0026rdquo; That, obviously, won\u0026rsquo;t sort chronologically.\nThen I have tags. Pretty self-explanatory. These are the topics I think relate to this note.\nFinally, I have the type property with the value fleeting.\nAfter I do my block properties, I make child blocks to insert quotations, related notes, further context, etc.\nI keep mentioning that I query these fleeting notes. What I do is insert the following query in the default queries section of config.edn:\n{:title \u0026#34;💡 FLEETING\u0026#34; :query (and (property type fleeting) (not (property template)) (not (task done))) :collapsed? true :breadcrumb-show? false :result-transform (fn [result] (sort-by (fn [h] (get-in h [:block/properties :date])) \u0026gt; result))} This query creates a section in my daily journal page called FLEETING (with a cute lightbulb emoji). It looks for all blocks that have the property key type with the value fleeting. I don\u0026rsquo;t want my template to show up, so I tell it to exclude the property key template. And because I only I want fleeting notes I haven\u0026rsquo;t acted on to show up, I tell it to exclude any blocks with the task marker DONE. I also tell the query to collapse the results and not to show the \u0026ldquo;breadcrumb trail\u0026rdquo; of where the block comes from.\nThe tricky part is having it sort my notes by date. I have it get the property date, and the greater than symbol \u0026gt; makes it sort with the newest notes at the top. I might play around and do it the other way so I see my oldest notes first.\nDefault queries are inserted into the current daily journal page (but not previous daily journal pages). The default queries that come with the default config.edn are the NOW and LATER queries. Here\u0026rsquo;s what those queries and my FLEETING query look like in action (I\u0026rsquo;ve uncollapsed the FLEETING notes):\nAlso Step 1: Reference Notes Often, I\u0026rsquo;ll make fleeting notes in response to something I\u0026rsquo;m reading, watching, listening to, etc. In that case, I\u0026rsquo;ll make a reference note for whatever resource it is. Sometimes, I\u0026rsquo;ll do this first because I\u0026rsquo;m reading something I know is related to a current interest of mine.\nReference notes start as entries in my Zotero library.\nThen, for resources I know I\u0026rsquo;m going to make notes from or cite, I create a page for it using Logseq\u0026rsquo;s Zotero integration.\nSometimes, I leave it at that. Usually, this happens if it\u0026rsquo;s one quotation from the source I\u0026rsquo;m using, or it\u0026rsquo;s short or familiar to me already.\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s something like a journal article, a book, or any type of resource I want to dig deeper into, I take notes on this page. If there\u0026rsquo;s a PDF, I take notes by using Logseq\u0026rsquo;s PDF reader. When I highlight passages in the PDF, an annotations page is created with the text of each highlight; each block in that page is actually a block reference to the highlight in the PDF.\nInstead of taking lengthy notes and summaries, I create an index when I read. That index is guided by what I\u0026rsquo;m actively interested in at the moment. I\u0026rsquo;m not creating a general index of the resource. When I take a highlight, I can actually change the text in the block that\u0026rsquo;s created. I mention briefly what the highlight is about, and I tag it with a topic. The text is usually themed around that topic. If I were reading with a different topic in mind, what I write for that highlight might be different.4\nI embed the highlights page under a Notes block in my reference note.\nI create all reference notes from the daily journal page. I technically have a template for it, but really, all I do is give it a block property of type:: [[reference]] and the date, like I did for fleeting notes. Sometimes, I\u0026rsquo;ll assign tags.\n- insert reference here date:: tags:: type:: [[reference]] I have a page titled Reference Notes where I query all my reference notes.\nI use this query:\n{{query (and (property type reference) (not (property template)))}} Step 2: Zettel Time Time to write some notes!\nAs with everything else, I create the permanent note from the daily journal page using the following template:\n- LATER [[]] date:: tags:: areas:: [[🍀 Digital Garden]], [[🗃 Zettelkasten]] type:: [[permanent]] status:: draft Let\u0026rsquo;s break this down.\nI give it the task marker LATER so I can query it in my Newsletter workflow; the query for that will make the block disappear when I mark it DONE. My workflow and queries are inspired by Ramses Oudt:\nAfter I publish my weekly newsletter, I remove the LATER from the original block.\nThen I create the page. I use an alphanumeric system at the beginning of my note titles because I\u0026rsquo;m following a Folgezettel structure.5 A Folgezettel is a \u0026ldquo;follow-up note.\u0026rdquo; A Zettelkasten is [[rhizomatic]] and non-hierarchical, but you can indicate trains of thought or a cluster about a topic by using Folgezettel. I\u0026rsquo;ll use some recent notes to demonstrate.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see two Zettels there: 7 Personal knowledge management could be the Modernist urge to reinforce Grand Narratives and 7a Personal knowledge management can come from a state of play. The 7 doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean any particular thing except that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t directly related to the previous 6 topics. 7a means it\u0026rsquo;s a follow-up to 7.\nAfter the alphanumeric indicator, I write my actual title as a statement.6 Then I do all the standard block properties we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing, like date and tags. For areas, this template has both 🍀 Digital Garden and 🗃 Zettelkasten; I only use one depending on the type of permanent note. In this case, I\u0026rsquo;ll remove 🍀 Digital Garden. For type, this is a permanent note. The status is draft until I finish it.\nJust like with my fleeting notes, I have a default query that shows me all my drafts in reverse chronological sort:\n{:title \u0026#34;📝 DRAFTS\u0026#34; :query (and (property status draft) (not (property template))) :collapsed? true :breadcrumb-show? false :result-transform (fn [result] (sort-by (fn [h] (get-in h [:block/properties :date])) \u0026gt; result))}]} Now I can go into the page I just created. I have a template I use for all my Zettels:\n- date:: title:: tags:: category:: Zettelkasten - Zettel goes here. - \u0026gt; source[^1] - [^1]: Source goes here. - ----- - - parent - ----- - - I think this note relates to this other note. For date, I do YYYY-MM-DD because that\u0026rsquo;s what is needed for the Hugo static site generator and theme I use. Title, if not auto-generated by Logseq, is just the title of note. Category is something for my website; I have Zettelkasten, blog, info, art, stuff like that. Then of course I have tags.\nNext is where I write the actual note. To reiterate: this is not me rewriting something in my own words. This is my interpretation of something. This is me creating my own ideas in conversation with something else.7\nI usually include the quotation I\u0026rsquo;m interacting with as a Markdown quotation, and I use Markdown footnotes to source it.\nIf the note is a Folgezettel, I link the parent note.\nThen, I put this note in conversation with other notes in my Zettelkasten. This is where a lot of the direct linking between my notes happens.\nStep 3: Ouroboros Just because they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;permanent\u0026rdquo; notes, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they can\u0026rsquo;t change. My Zettelkasten is a living thing that grows and changes. I can revisit notes and make new connections. I can break a note up into multiple new notes.\nWhen I see I have enough notes on a topic, I can create something about it. That thing I create can inform other notes and inspire new notes.\nThe ouroboros is a mythical serpent eating its own tail. It shows up in many different cultures and belief systems.

I know it\u0026rsquo;s not as pretty or big as some others you may have seen, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s a great way to see how I use Logseq, its linking capabilities, and its integrations.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see some clusters there in the center. That represents the reference notes, topic tags, and main notes of my Zettelkasten. Some of the bigger nodes are reference notes because Logseq brings in the Zotero tags, and I create an author page for each. That messy web dead center is the majority of the main notes. I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough to create super visible hubs, but it makes me happy that those notes don\u0026rsquo;t create the \u0026ldquo;node with spokes\u0026rdquo; structure that the reference notes have.\nOkay, so what are all the other notes floating aimlessly around the messy web? That\u0026rsquo;s a great question.\nThose are the highlights I\u0026rsquo;ve taken in various web articles and e-books as well as tweets and Twitter threads I\u0026rsquo;ve saved. They\u0026rsquo;re brought in through the official Logseq Readwise plugin.\nWhat is Readwise? Readwise is a read-it-later service which imports the highlights you take in other websites and apps. For example, any highlights you make in a Kindle book will be sent to Readwise. You can also manually enter highlights or take pictures of physical books to highlight. Once highlights are in Readwise, it prompts you every day to review highlights using spaced repetition.\nWhy use Readwise? I admit to having been skeptical when I first heard of Readwise. I\u0026rsquo;m not a student, and I don\u0026rsquo;t feel the need to memorize stuff I read, especially when I\u0026rsquo;m reading for fun. The only reason I gave it a go was because I got a free annual subscription through the Building a Second Brain course I did. I started using it, and I liked it well enough to keep using it. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to review highlights from books, web articles, and even tweets I haven\u0026rsquo;t visited in a long time. Still, just revisiting highlights isn\u0026rsquo;t meeting any need of mine, at least not one I would pay for.\nHowever, what turned Readwise into a crucial part of my workflow is its ability to export highlights to other apps and services. In addition to reviewing highlights in the app every day, I also have those highlights in my note-taking apps to search and use. I used the Evernote integration for a while, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really do thinking and creating work in Evernote. Evernote is my filing cabinet. I can full-text search and bring highlights up, but then I have to move those notes around, copy/paste, duplicate, whatever, if I want to use those exact quotations in something. I can\u0026rsquo;t easily connect them to anything.\nThen, I got brought on to test the official Logseq integration.\nLogseq Integration I mentioned that I use Evernote as my filing cabinet in my \u0026ldquo;second brain.\u0026rdquo; My other primary tool is Logseq. To quickly introduce it: Logseq is a free, open source outliner and note-taking program which prioritizes local files and privacy. It exists in the same type of app as Roam Research and Obsidian, which allow you to connect notes through backlinks. Logseq, like Roam Research, allows you to reference and embed at the \u0026ldquo;block\u0026rdquo; level, not just the page level.\nThe ability to reference/embed at the block level is what makes Logseq work so well with Readwise. For example, one thing I love about Readwise is that it can save Twitter threads. I used to hate bookmarking the first tweet in a thread, or even bookmarking every single tweet in the thread. In Readwise, I can find that thread and review it, but the individual tweets will be split when doing a daily review. I often review tweets out of context with the rest of their thread. In Logseq, however, Readwise creates a new page for each larger work a highlight is in –– a page for each book you have highlights in, for each article you have highlights in, etc. And for twitter threads, it creates a page for that entire thread.\nAnd each individual highlight has its own block on that page, allowing me to embed and reference it when needed. The highlights don\u0026rsquo;t exist out of context of their larger work, but I can still use them individually in a way that is linked back to the larger context.\nThe integration also creates page links for the author of the larger work and the category (but I remove the category link). It brings in any tags you\u0026rsquo;ve made in Readwise for the larger work and the individual highlights and any notes you\u0026rsquo;ve made for each highlight. Finally, it provides external links to the original source if applicable, including links to individual tweets and Kindle locations.\nMy configuration Before I walk you through the parts of my workflow which include Readwise, I want to explain my setup and configuration. My setup is not complicated, but it is not the default, either.\nThere are several options to configure. For example, you can automatically sync new highlights when you open Logseq. I don\u0026rsquo;t do this because highlights are only as good as their original page metadata, and I often have to change authors in Readwise. For Logseq in particular, I have to make sure titles don\u0026rsquo;t contain forward slashes because forward slashes will create namespaces. Disabling autosync gives me time to clean up any metadata before I bring it into my graph. You can also choose to resync deleted pages. I turn this on when I notice some bad metadata or formatting that needs fixing, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have it on as the default.\nWhen you click \u0026ldquo;Customize\u0026rdquo; for formatting options, you have several more options to configure. I choose to leave on \u0026ldquo;Include Highlight Location,\u0026rdquo; and I turn on \u0026ldquo;Use Custom Formatting.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen you turn on Custom Formatting, you can change the template Readwise uses to create your highlights pages.\nThe first is the page title. I am fine with the default because having (highlights) in the title provides an easy way to search and filter without creating a giant page node in my graph.\nThen we have page metadata. I change the default in two ways. The first is that I put quotation marks around the full title value. Otherwise, multiple pages will be created if the title has a comma in it. However, this default may have changed by time of publication or sometime after. I also remove the tag from category. I don\u0026rsquo;t want a giant cluster in my graph, and I don\u0026rsquo;t need to see every source I have that\u0026rsquo;s a book. Some people might, though! This is just my preference.\nReadwise creates a header to nest highlights under. I remove the backlinks from where it says Readwise because I don\u0026rsquo;t want a giant page node in my graph view. That is a connection that isn\u0026rsquo;t useful to me, but it might be for you.\nFor the actual highlight, I don\u0026rsquo;t change anything. I would like to make the Tags a block property, but I\u0026rsquo;m not skilled enough to figure that out. I edit as needed.\nFinally, there\u0026rsquo;s the sync notification. Because I haven\u0026rsquo;t created a Readwise page in the highlights header, there\u0026rsquo;s no place for this notification text to go. I just leave it as the default.\nAnd, like with other Readwise exports, you can choose to select specific items or sync everything.\nWorkflow I use Logseq as my digital Zettelkasten, and my workflow is fairly traditional. With a focus on how Readwise fits in, here\u0026rsquo;s what it looks like:\nI\u0026rsquo;m reading an e-book, an online article or blog, or tweets; I don\u0026rsquo;t use Readwise for scholarly articles which I have as PDFs. I make highlights related to a current interest of mine, either because I\u0026rsquo;m reading for that interest or because I notice something that relates even when reading for fun.\nWhen reviewing highlights, I\u0026rsquo;ll add topic tags and notes as appropriate. After making sure all the metadata and formatting is cleaned up (seriously, remove the markdown footnotes if you highlight Wikipedia articles), I sync those highlights in Logseq to create pages. The pages generated by Readwise now become one part of an eventual reference (or literature) note.\nI have some fleeting notes, and I decide to make a Zettel (or main note) out of one. Because what I want to say is usually in response to something else, I like to make a reference note for that something else. If the source is not already in my Zotero library, I add it. Then, I make a page for that reference in Logseq via the Zotero integration. If I also have Readwise highlights for that reference, I put a page reference in the reference note to the highlights page.\nNow, when I write my Zettel, I can cite my source by linking to my reference note.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t link to the Readwise highlights page, but because that page is linked in my reference note, a link is created between it and my main note I\u0026rsquo;ve just written. I can also do block references with specific highlights I want to use as quotations. However, I don\u0026rsquo;t do this because I publish my Zettelkasten online, and it can only handle block references to other pages I\u0026rsquo;ve published; I don\u0026rsquo;t put my Readwise highlights or reference notes online. There is a Logseq plugin which allows you to swap a block reference and a block, but when I\u0026rsquo;ve tried it in this workflow, the block id gets included in the Hugo-compatible Markdown.\nAnd honestly, that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much the main workflow!\nOther uses I do not makes notes of everything I read, watch, or listen to just for the sake of making notes. But a nice thing about having my captured highlights in Logseq is seeing how clusters form, generatively, without me necessarily having done anything.\nLet me explain.\nLike how the Zotero integration brings in tags, so too does the Readwise integration. This includes the hashtags in tweets, in addition to whatever tags I\u0026rsquo;ve added to a highlight. The giant cluster at the top of my graph isn\u0026rsquo;t any sort of \u0026ldquo;main note\u0026rdquo; cluster at all: it\u0026rsquo;s a cluster of Readwise highlights linked to the page \u0026ldquo;art.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s so big because a lot of tweets I send to Readwise that have art in them have the hashtag \u0026ldquo;art.\u0026rdquo;\nSometimes, I will review highlights to see what tags or notes I might add. I use the Logseq Random Note plugin for that, and because so many of my Logseq pages are actually from Readwise, a lot of the notes I see when using the Random Note plugin are Readwise highlights.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t tag every note that comes up. Just like when I\u0026rsquo;m reading, I only try to add tags or notes that are relevant to a current interest of mine. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to tag this incredible tweet of David Duchovny on Celebrity Jeopardy with \u0026ldquo;frogs\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;X-Files.\u0026rdquo; But if I see something that is related to a topic, I\u0026rsquo;ll tag it or add a related existing page.\nI\u0026rsquo;m beyond excited to see where the Logseq Readwise plugin goes. I love it so much as is, and it\u0026rsquo;s only just starting. I think Logseq and other tools which include block references are a perfect match for Readwise. It\u0026rsquo;s so nice to be able to link to or embed individual highlights without those highlights having to be on their own pages out of context.\nI am also not someone who thinks we need to do something with every bit of information we interact with; I get exhausted just thinking about the people who write huge book summary reading notes for every single thing they read. But having Readwise highlights in Logseq allows me to add notes, tags, and links to highlights as needed. Plus, Logseq\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Unlinked References\u0026rdquo; section and the Random Note plugin can create moments of serendipitous discovery.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s how note-taking and personal information management should be: serendipitous and fun.\nShameless plug time To whoever reads this: I would love to hear about your workflows, especially if you use Zotero.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re curious about using Zotero in a workflow which includes the Readwise integration, I offer coaching, mentoring, and consultation for Zotero in personal information management.

Thank you for coming to my presentation when you could just leave and go outside. My name is Jay L. Colbert, and today I\u0026rsquo;ll be presenting \u0026ldquo;Describing Absence: The Complicated Power of Metadata Surrogates in Libraries \u0026amp; Archives\u0026rdquo;\nAdvanced notice that this presentation will mention suicide and potentially upsetting language. I will warn you before those slides.\nThere is also a slide with a YouTube video.\nContents First, I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you a bit about myself and why I\u0026rsquo;m talking about this issue.\nNext, I\u0026rsquo;ll define some of the ideas central to this presentation. It\u0026rsquo;s important that you are aware of how I\u0026rsquo;m using these terms so that we\u0026rsquo;re all on the same page.\nThen, I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss archival silence and why it\u0026rsquo;s such a problem, using three examples.\nAnd before we move on, I\u0026rsquo;ll do a brief intermission, which will lead us into\u0026hellip;\nwhy archival silence can actually be a good thing. I know, a bit spicy considering the theme of this workshop.\nWho am I So, who am I.\nI\u0026rsquo;m the Metadata \u0026amp; Discovery Strategy Librarian at the University of New Hampshire, with Assistant Professor Rank. I am also the Metadata Librarian for the New Hampshire Digital Library and our emerging project to become a DPLA hub.\nI am on the Editorial Board for the Homosaurus, an international LGBTQ linked data vocabulary. It is a controlled vocabulary, and galleries, libraries, archives, and museums all over the world use it in their descriptive metadata. If you are curious about using it in your collections, please reach out to me.\nAnd\u0026hellip;I am not an archivist. I have worked with EADXML, but I have no formal archival training. The archivists, in the room and on Zoom, you are the experts, not me. If I am completely misunderstanding something, feel free to let me know.\nDefinitions Moving on to our definitions.\nPlease forgive me if this first definition seems elementary. We\u0026rsquo;ve all heard the \u0026ldquo;metadata is data about data\u0026rdquo; definition. And while that definition is accurate, I find it unhelpful for describing what metadata is for and what it can do.\nInstead, I like the definition from the Getty book Introduction to Metadata. Thanks to Elliot Williams who assigns sections of this book in his Metadata and Description for Digital Special Collections Library Juice Academy course.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps a more useful, “big picture” way of thinking about metadata is as the sum total of what one can say at a given moment about any information object at any level of aggregation. In this context, an information object is anything that can be addressed and manipulated as a discrete entity by a human being or an information system. The object may be a single item, an aggregate of many items, or an entire database or record-keeping system. Indeed, in any given instance one can expect to find metadata relevant to any information object existing simultaneously at the item, aggregate, and system levels.\u0026rdquo;1\nFor example, your driver\u0026rsquo;s license, if you have one, has metadata that describes you. But if you move, get a different class of license, etc, in ten years, that metadata will change.\nAnd because that metadata is what can be said about you, a person, it can also be viewed as a surrogate.\nAgain, from the Introduction to Metadata book, digital surrogates are the digital versions of \u0026ldquo;actual\u0026rdquo; collection content, and descriptive surrogates are the description of that content. If my library scans the Town Report of Dover in 1962, that PDF or whatever file format is the digital surrogate and the metadata record my colleagues create is the descriptive surrogate. In an AV course I took in grad school, the professor even said that a metadata surrogate can be a form of preservation; if it\u0026rsquo;s good enough, someone might not need to interact with the physical object.\nFinally, archival silence. The Society of American Archivists defines it as \u0026ldquo;the unintentional or purposeful absence or distortion of documentation of enduring value, resulting in gaps and inabilities to represent the past accurately.\u0026rdquo;2\nI have some criticisms of this definition. First, it does not mention the destruction of documentation. Second, what does \u0026ldquo;enduring value\u0026rdquo; mean. Who gets to decide what has value and what does not? And finally, it is impossible to accurately represent the past, and why must silence only happen in contexts where we\u0026rsquo;re trying to represent the past.\nWhen archival silence is bad\u0026hellip; An immediate example: this photo is from a collection of warped headshots from a theater company. The name of the man in the photo is not given.\nWarning that the next slide has potentially upsetting language, and I will be discussing suicide. If you leave, I will not be offended. If you would like someone to bring you back in when I\u0026rsquo;m finished with the slide, that is okay, too. I will not find it disruptive or disrespectful. The article [[The Image of Absence: Archival Silence]] by [[Lauren F. Klein]] begins with an excerpt of a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote to his friend William Evans.\nYou mentioned to me in conversation here that you sometimes saw my former servant James, \u0026amp; that he made his engagements such as to keep himself always free to come to me. Could I get the favor of you to send for him \u0026amp; tell him I shall be glad to receive him as soon as he can come to me?\nAlthough this letter does not name him, the \u0026ldquo;former servant James\u0026rdquo; is James Hemings, the brother of Sally Hemings, as well as an accomplished chef.\nSo why does the descriptive surrogate matter so much here?\n\u0026ldquo;The only reason this letter appears in the list of results for a keyword search on “James Hemings” is that the editors of the Papers of Thomas Jefferson have noted that the “former servant” refers to Hemings, and this information has been added to the digital version of the document as metadata. Because the default scope of a keyword search in the Digital Edition includes this extratextual information, as well as the text of the document itself, a researcher need not distinguish between textual content and editorial note. But should the researcher begin, instead, with a “Name” search for James Hemings as either an author or a recipient of a letter, even across the estimated 25,000 documents that the Digital Edition presently contains, he or she would be returned no results.\u0026rdquo;\nNext, we have the Utah American Indian Digital Archive. I used to work at the University of Utah, where I did a project with the Utah American Indian Digital Archive. I analyzed their metadata to look at silences and other ethical concerns, and I developed a best practices for describing items related to Indigenous people. For example, how many photos had an \u0026ldquo;Unnamed Navajo woman\u0026rdquo; next to a named Mormon missionary settler colonizer? How many documents used language like \u0026ldquo;problems with Indians\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;savages?\u0026rdquo; Even though the Ute and Navajo people are represented in this collection, that terminology is a distortion, as it gives the point of view of the colonizers. However, I would not want to get rid of that information. It is more important to reckon with our mistakes than to obfuscate them.3\nA suggestion I made was to not authority control for Mormon settlers in photographs with unnamed Indigenous people. Put that information in a notes field so it\u0026rsquo;s indexed and discoverable, but do not provide that access point.\nIf there are silences we cannot fix, make them loud.\nFinally, I want to tell you about Bibliographer B. A quick lesson about the study of Shakespeare Compositors. Particularly before WWII, a popular form of research in Shakespeare studies was looking at the folios and whatnot and trying to parse out who put it together and edited it, and if that person composited others. This takes a lot of linguistic analysis, studying how someone writes and spells, their editing choices, all that.\nIt should not be surprising, therefore, that, when some of these men fought in WWII, they used those skills for cryptography and espionage.\n\u0026ldquo;But hiatus, to backtrack for a moment, is not the best word for what happened to American bibliographic study during the Second World War, for, as I want to suggest, compositor analysis was not so much suspended as produced by the war, in some important ways. Before the United States entered the war, Bowers “had been given secret instruction as a cryptanalyst in a naval communications group being formed at the university [of Virginia]”; during the war he moved to Washington “to supervise an intelligence unit working on deciphering enemy codes.” Among a number of prominent literary/bibliographic scholars, the unit included Charlton Hinman. Hinman in fact got the idea for the collating machine he later invented to compare Shakespeare folio pages from “the method followed in the intelligence unit for comparing successive photographs of enemy fortifications, to see whether changes had been made.”\u0026rdquo;4\nAfter, a little something called McCarthyism happens. Removing Communists from government positions and higher education. But also, there was the Lavender Scare, of also removing queer people from government positions and higher education.\nBut you can\u0026rsquo;t just look at someone and tell that they\u0026rsquo;re queer. Instead, to root out homosexuality, they studied their behaviors, their affects, any visible signs they could find.\nThis brings us to Bibliographer B, who studied Shakespeare Compositors at the University of Virginia.\n\u0026ldquo;He published in Studies on compositor analysis in a number of Shakespeare plays, and, early one morning in March of 1955—and now I am quoting from the local newspapers—Bibliographer B, “who was 37 and unmarried, shot himself in the right side of the head with a .22 calibre pistol.”\u0026rdquo;5\nThe reports of his suicide also mention that he was found cleanly shaven and dressed, as if they expected him to be otherwise. The reports are basically doing everything but calling him a \u0026ldquo;confirmed bachelor.\u0026rdquo; They don\u0026rsquo;t say he\u0026rsquo;s gay, but that silence tells us everything.\nEspecially considering that a set of papers related to his death, including committee reports on his case, have been destroyed by the University of Virginia. Jeffrey Masten, the author of the book [[Queer philologies: sex, language, and affect in Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s time]] , contacted the special collections at UVA and learned that the documents were destroyed \u0026ldquo;according to the records management guidelines enacted by the Commonwealth of Virginia.\u0026rdquo;\nAs a result of the inquiry, UVA Special Collections deleted the record from the public catalog. Brief intermission on data privacy and surveillance A brief intermission about privacy and surveillance.\nPrivacy is our right to choose when, how, why, and how much we share information about ourselves.\nOur privacy is violated constantly by corporate tracking and data mining, and government surveillance.\nRaise your hand if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever gone into your Facebook settings and looked at the \u0026ldquo;ad preferences.\u0026rdquo; It guesses all this information about what you like, your political affiliations, your sexuality, all sorts of things. You can go in and edit it, but it\u0026rsquo;s opt-out, not opt-in.\nFacebook, Google, Amazon, and loads of other corporations track your browsing habits and mine data from your phone, as well.\nFacebook can do this even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a Facebook account.\nIn a capitalist society, governments and corporations construct surrogates of us from the data they mine. And in a capitalist society, that data surrogate is more \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; and has more value than we do because it makes them money. Everything about us is exploited, and we do not even know the true extent of that exploitation. Except that it can absolutely be used against us when we are no longer valuable.\n\u0026hellip;and when it\u0026rsquo;s good Therefore, it is not always a bad thing to have silences in our collections. Sometimes, those silences are necessary.\nPrivacy and legality We have two examples of archives and special collections potentially (and actually) exposing the participants of oral histories to criminalization.\nThe first is The Belfast Project at Boston College which collected the oral histories of IRA members. There were several protocols put in place to protect participants.\nFirst, the participants were referred to under pseudonyms, and only one person could have the entire key that detailed who was who. Secondly, nobody external to the project was supposed to know about it. Those outside of the Boston College Library were not to be trusted or consulted with in regards to any knowledge of the project. This meant that everything, from the legal documents to the documentation and storage of the interviews, was kept secret from all Boston College experts, lawyers, and consultants.\nFinally, the tapes were not to be released until after their respective interviewees had died. However, they made a major mistake: they did not consider that people mentioned in the interviews might still be alive when the tapes were released. In 2008, Brendan Hughes, a former IRA fighter, died.\nIn 2010, Ed Moloney released a book which used Hughes\u0026rsquo; tapes. And in that was information about Jean McConville, a \u0026ldquo;Disappeared\u0026rdquo; woman assumed to be murdered by the IRA. Naturally, the tapes\u0026ndash;now known to the public\u0026ndash;were subpoenaed. And guess what? The interviews had not been properly redacted nor did Boston College have a proper redaction policy. An IRA member, Ivor Bell, was sentenced to a \u0026ldquo;trial of the facts\u0026rdquo; because of his deteriorating mental health. The judge ruled the Boston College tapes were not admissible, however, and Bell walked free.6\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s the Histories of Choice collection at Florida Gulf University, \u0026ldquo;an ethnographic recollection of Roe v. Wade that provides historical context of different perspectives and lived experiences centered around the theme of abortion.\u0026rdquo; The issue: some of these oral histories contain information from when abortion was criminalized. And in our current climate, and even in some states currently, the information that might not be criminalized now could be in the future. How do we ensure access, including with our descriptive metadata, that will not result in criminalization? What is the statute of limitations? How can we protect these people?\nTheir solution: staff members who were comfortable with the subject matter redacted PII: name, age, location, hometown, graduation year, etc. Then they would swap transcripts and do the redaction process again. The names of participants were also removed from all master metadata and accession records. All previous versions of the transcripts were deleted, as were the original audio recordings. The public record of the project is the only record in existence; there is no additional data for a legal entity to subpoena.7\nGovernment interference This next example is hypothetical.\nI have a colleague and friend in Texas who had begun working on a project concerning oral history projects with undocumented immigrants, and the ethical and legal challenges of doing so. He was kind enough to share his notes with me when I was talking about my presentation with him.\nIn those notes, a strategy he and his collaborators came up with was to \u0026ldquo;go through the worst case scenario\u0026rdquo;:\nOral history program gets started, all the recommendations we’ve made are put into place. Some of the redacted materials are released or publicized and anger anti-immigrant groups. We then begin receiving FOIA requests so they can attempt to identify the subjects in the interviews and report them to ICE or find other incriminating evidence against the participants. Because we’ve destroyed the originals with PII, it’s unlikely, but with all the information people can glean online, these FOIA’d items could then end up on a public website for people to attempt to identify the subjects who have been anonymized. At this point the library wields its copyright to take down the website before the subjects can be identified. This may garner more scrutiny for the university, but at least the actual process of doxxing people who have entrusted us with their stories can be halted. Also, it’s worth pointing out that doing nothing will also not put a stop to this harassment campaign.\nThis could also apply to other scenarios, such as oral histories of domestic abuse where abusers might recognize themselves in a story and attempt to get the current information on their victims.\nGiving space back Not every culture, group, or community is going to have the same knowledge management, knowledge transmission, or knowledge organization systems as the dominant library/archival science framework. There are oral traditions of music transmission, there are Tibetan Buddhist practices that are only shared between lama and student in an unending lineage back to the Buddha, there are traditions where information is only shared within that group. I am not one who advocates for our default diversity, equity, and inclusion response to be absorbing the systems of other cultures into our own, creating a mono-system. Instead, I advocate for giving space back to these other ways of describing information, as well as working with communities to see where sharing and collaboration can happen with mutual trust.8\nWhat may sound like silence to us could actually be an orchestra to another culture.\nOther ways of archiving In addition to there being cultures whose descriptive and archival practices differ from the dominant\u0026rsquo;s, I argue that even within our culture there are ways of describing certain information and experiences better than could be done in a finding aid.\nAn example and analysis I love comes from the article [[Archiving the Wonders of Testosterone Via YouTube]] by [[Tobias Raun]] :\nThe article engages with trans male video blogs on YouTube, framing them as living archives that offer unique opportunities to access and share embodied trans knowledges—which have previously been limited or inaccessible—such as information about and visual accounts of medical transitioning processes. It is argued that archiving one’s transition works through a kind of performative documentation, partly documenting and partly instantiating the transformation by tracking and tracing the bodily changes.9\nI cannot get enough of the idea that a trans man documenting his transition and experience with HRT via YouTube is creating metadata from, with, and of his body. If metadata is the sum total of what can be said about any information object at any given time, then the bodies of trans people undergoing medical forms of transition are living, always-changing metadata records. They are the information object, and they are also what can be said about the information object.\nMy transsexual body is a catalog, a finding aid, of every testosterone injection I have given myself in my thigh, of the parts of my body I have willingly destroyed to create something better in their wake, of the process of teaching myself to shave my face (which is way different than shaving your legs, it turns out), of the ways my sexuality changed, of the hours of speech and movement therapy I did, of the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m still afraid to use gendered bathrooms in public after 4 years. That cannot be represented in a finding aid, no matter how hard we might try. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t try, but I think we need to admit our shortcomings and accept them.\nI also want us to think about representation, and why we\u0026rsquo;re trying to put it in our metadata. Is it to actually connect with communities? Or is it to go along with the thing you think is right because you saw three other institutions do it on Twitter and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to look bad?\nWhat is more important: representation, or the material reality and consequences that our good-faith efforts can affect?\nPermission to FORGET Even outside of our silences, we need to face one inevitable fact: we cannot describe and collect all information. In fact, we might lose it, damage it, destroy it, or fail to get it in the first place.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nNothing is permanent. When we accept that, we can better prepare for the gradual loss of information.\nWe do not take care of the shadows I was reading a newsletter by Robin Rendle where he mentioned the book In Praise of Shadows by Junichiro Tanizaki. A main argument of this book is that Westerners do not appreciate shadows. We put lamps everywhere, trying to fill every space with light. But what if we treated our shadows with the same respect? What if we saw the beauty in them, how they bring form to emptiness,10 how they define the beauty of the surrounding light?\nIn that newsletter, Robin says,\n\u0026ldquo;(We do not take care of the shadows.)\u0026rdquo;\nWe do not take care of our silences, good or bad, and I think we should.\n[[Setting the Stage]] , Introduction to Metadata\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n[[@archival silence]] Dictionary of Archives Terminology\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSee [[Queering the Catalog: Queer Theory and the Politics of Correction]] by [[Emily Drabinski]]\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n[[Queer philologies: sex, language, and affect in Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s time]] by [[Jeffrey Masten]]\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIbid.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n[[The Belfast Project: How an American University almost Started a Civil War]] by [[Andres Ruiz]]\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n[[Testimonies: The rewards and challenges of letting their voices be heard]] by [[Melissa Minds VandeBurgt]], [[Bailey Mae Rodgers]], and [[Kinsey Brown]]\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFun fact: in order to be a professionally registered librarian in Aotearoa (New Zealand), you have to demonstrate competency in Māori knowledge systems.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nEmphasis mine\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSorry to keep getting Buddhist on main.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/describing-absence-the-complicated-power-of-metadata-surrogates-in-libraries-and-archives/","summary":"These are the speaker notes of a talk I gave at the New Hampshire Archives Group Spring 2022 Workshop on [[May 17th, 2022]]\nGood afternoon, everyone.

The video or blog post will always go over the basics of what a second brain is, and it usually mentions that the person took Tiago Forte\u0026rsquo;s Building a Second Brain course.\nSo I guess it\u0026rsquo;s my turn.\nWhat is Building a Second Brain Building a Second Brain is a methodology, online course, and (as of writing this post) forthcoming book by Tiago Forte. It\u0026rsquo;s a framework for personal knowledge management which helps to relieve information overload, build connections between our notes, and helps us express our ideas. I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna go into the whole structure and method here; you can read Tiago\u0026rsquo;s many posts about it.\nOn the surface level, the system seems focused on Capital P Productivity to help you create Capital C Content so you can market it and make money and be an entrepreneur and CEO and on and on and on. However, I noticed something surprising during the course: the mentors whose sessions I attended, many of my fellow students, and even Tiago kept emphasizing pleasure, joy, sensual experience in the body, resonance — all these things I absolutely did not expect. Sure, there was a healthy contingent of people focused on marketing and making money and whatnot. Fine, good for them. But otherwise, this course I took because I\u0026rsquo;m an ADHD mess and also a nerd for intertextuality and knowledge organization turned out to be about much more than that.\nInstead of just being about how to Capture information, Organize it, Distill it, and Express it (remember, for Content you can Monetize), Building a Second Brain was about changing how I relate to information. Hell, it was about how I even define what information is. My mentors all stressed that the express part of the process includes how we live our lives, how we relate to the people around us, how we honor ourselves. One of the very first things I learned was not just how to capture information, but how to tell if it resonates with me, how that feels in my body. I\u0026rsquo;m already interested in the [[erotics of metadata]] and the [[aesthetics of information]], this was perfect!\nWhy I\u0026rsquo;m Interested I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a person who loves seeing how texts connect. A lot of the movies, music, and literature I love are because I would read or watch or listen to something in high school, look up whatever movie or band or book it mentioned, rinse repeat. In college, the kinds of connections I would make and insights I would have when writing my English papers were\u0026hellip;odd, to be kind about it. And then I became a metadata librarian, where I figure out how to connect and organize information for a living so other people can find it and use it.1\nYou would assume, then, that I would be amazing at managing all the knowledge and information I interact with. Ha, you\u0026rsquo;re very funny. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a bunch of things over the years. In 2019, I encountered Tiago\u0026rsquo;s PARA organization system. I tried setting it up, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t really stick with it. But starting there, I eventually went down a bunch of rabbit holes and learned about Zettelkasten and digital gardens and Roam Research and networked thought and wow, it blew my mind. I am not always great at using folder hierarchies, and I\u0026rsquo;m also not great at tagging. Connecting ideas while writing, linking directly to a title, makes so much more sense to me.\nAs a metadata librarian, I\u0026rsquo;m interested in how the Building a Second Brain framework views information, how we relate to information, and how information relates to other information. I\u0026rsquo;m so excited to see how I might bring in some of what I learned to library metadata, even though that is moving the micro to the macro.\nHow I Build My Second Brain Alright enough chit chat.\nI want to preface this by saying:\nAs of writing, my system is barely a month old It is messy, imperfect, and always subject to change as my needs change What works for me absolutely will not work for you because no two second brains will look alike. However, I hope seeing how I do it is useful! Tools It is possible to do a lot of this with free tools. However, I pay for Evernote, and I will pay for Readwise in a year when my trial from taking the course ends. Logseq, on the other hand, is free and open source, as all tools should be. Capture I capture information in four ways, depending on what the information is and why I\u0026rsquo;m capturing it. More often than not, I\u0026rsquo;m using one of Evernote\u0026rsquo;s various clippers, either for websites, email, or on my phone. It\u0026rsquo;s just so easy. Evernote sucks with Tweets though, so I usually capture those with Readwise or Logseq. I try to capture web articles2 and newsletters with Readwise, and Readwise also captures any Kindle highlights I take.3 I like to embed more visual tweets in Logseq, especially if they\u0026rsquo;re something I might want to reference in my digital garden. Most of my \u0026ldquo;fleeting notes\u0026rdquo;4 are taken in Logseq and then distilled later. Finally, I carry around a tiny notebook small enough to fit in my front jeans pocket, and I have a tiny fountain pen to match. I love fountain pens, and I love how tiny the notebook is. This makes it fun to write, and so I like using these tools.\nOrganize I use the PARA5 system anywhere I have notes of any kind. I even use it in my task manager. Mostly, things live in Evernote. It\u0026rsquo;s like a big filing cabinet, and I like it for keeping project notes all together. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think I would like it as much as I do (remember, I hate folders and tags), but because I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to link thoughts together, I like it just fine.\nDistill Tiago has his whole Progressive Summarization method of distilling. Basically, it\u0026rsquo;s taking the important (to you!) bits of the information you\u0026rsquo;re returning to and pulling them out, making them noticeable, so you can skim and use what you really need later. And this is all great and good, but you have to remember that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to do it all the time. You just do it when you need to do it, and not every note is going to require the same degree of it.\nMy digital garden and Zettelkasten are a form of distilling, and a cycle of divergence and convergence. Ideas start small, so I diverge and let them grow wild. Then, I converge and distill them to a polished Zettel.\nDistill can also be practiced via daily/weekly/monthly/annual reviews, where you distill your feelings and experiences.\nExpress Express is when you put everything together and create something new. I also like the framework of express referring to how we live our lives and relate to other people.\nRight now, my primary mode of expression would be this website, I suppose. My expression also includes any scholarly work I do, the conversations I have with my friends, the peace I feel knowing everything I might need to take care of my beloved cat is just one folder away, organizing with my fellow workers, the way I touch and move my body, and so much more.6\nI hope this was useful and even mildly interesting to anyone who isn\u0026rsquo;t me or from the whole #pkm scene.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re someone like me who loves knowledge management but also thinks most things to do with marketing and entrepreneurship and tech bros are embarrassing at best and ethically indefensible at worst, I would say give it a shot. I\u0026rsquo;m having a lot more fun with it than I expected, and it was worth every penny.\nI wonder how many other librarians have taken the course.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nI capture academic sources with Zotero.

Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.\nA garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren\u0026rsquo;t strictly organised by their publication date. They\u0026rsquo;re inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren\u0026rsquo;t refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They\u0026rsquo;re less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we\u0026rsquo;re used to seeing.\nA digital garden allows me to find connections between my thoughts and the things I\u0026rsquo;m interested in. I tend to my garden when I can. I can also see how my ideas grow over time. Because I make it public, you can witness all this. This is called [[learning in public]].\nStages of growth It is important to note that, during the growth process, all notes remain atomic.\n🌱 seedling notes aren\u0026rsquo;t quite the very start of an idea, but the note has enough in it that I can link it to other things and have it make sense to people who aren\u0026rsquo;t me (otherwise I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make it public)\n🌿 budding notes are cleaned up and have gone through a bit of distillation; maybe I\u0026rsquo;ve linked more things to them\n🌳 evergreen notes are at a stage when I can move them into my 🗃 Zettelkasten; they are mature enough to serve as building blocks for things I might write or otherwise express.\nDigital garden terms of service Because a digital garden exposes my ideas to the world, it puts me in a vulnerable position. Therefore, I ask that you follow the Digital Garden Terms of Service, and I promise to do the same.\n","permalink":"https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/digital-garden/","summary":"What is a digital garden?

In German, Zettelkasten means \u0026ldquo;slip box.\u0026rdquo; It is both a method of personal knowledge management and a physical (or digital) system you maintain. The method was popularized by German scholar Niklas Luhmann who used it as a \u0026ldquo;conversation partner\u0026rdquo; to help write hundreds of articles and books. To create a Zettelkasten, you need two compartments: literature notes and Zettels. Literature notes are just bibliographic information. Niklas Luhmann wrote the citations of resources on index cards. I keep my references in Zotero. Zettels are what you will see in my digital garden as 🌳 evergreen notes. They are not notes I would take while reading something. Rather, they are insights and my own thoughts on what I read or in general. Zettels should be one idea, called an atomic idea. Remember: Niklas Luhmann wrote his Zettels on index cards. Although they are a tidied up atomic idea, they are not immutable.\nAs you write Zettels, you create links between them. The more Zettels you have, and the more links exist between them, the easier it is to see where clusters of ideas form. This is the \u0026ldquo;conversation partner\u0026rdquo; aspect of the Zettelkasten. When clusters form, it shows you what you\u0026rsquo;re interested in and where you have a lot of information already created. From there, you can combine the Zettels and use them to express something larger and more complex.\nYou can learn more about Zettelkasten at zettelkasten.de. I also like how Bob Doto explains the Zettelkasten.\n","permalink":"https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/zettelkasten/","summary":"What is a Zettelkasten?
