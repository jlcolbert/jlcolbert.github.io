[{"content":"What is a digital garden? To quote Maggie Appleton\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;A Brief History \u0026amp; Ethos of the Digital Garden\u0026rdquo;,\n They\u0026rsquo;re not following the conventions of the \u0026ldquo;personal blog,\u0026rdquo; as we\u0026rsquo;ve come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.\nA garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren\u0026rsquo;t strictly organised by their publication date. They\u0026rsquo;re inherently exploratory ‚Äì notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren\u0026rsquo;t refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They\u0026rsquo;re less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we\u0026rsquo;re used to seeing.\n A digital garden allows me to find connections between my thoughts and the things I\u0026rsquo;m interested in. I tend to my garden when I can. I can also see how my ideas grow over time. Because I make it public, you can witness all this. This is called [[learning in public]].\nStages of growth It is important to note that, during the growth process, all notes remain atomic.\n  üå± seedling notes aren\u0026rsquo;t quite the very start of an idea, but the note has enough in it that I can link it to other things and have it make sense to people who aren\u0026rsquo;t me (otherwise I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make it public)\n  üåø budding notes are cleaned up and have gone through a bit of distillation; maybe I\u0026rsquo;ve linked more things to them\n  üå≥ evergreen notes are at a stage when I can move them into my üóÉ Zettelkasten; they are mature enough to serve as building blocks for things I might write or otherwise express.\n   Digital garden terms of service Because a digital garden exposes my ideas to the world, it puts me in a vulnerable position. Therefore, I ask that you follow the Digital Garden Terms of Service, and I promise to do the same.\n","permalink":"https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/digital-garden/","summary":"What is a digital garden?

In German, Zettelkasten means \u0026ldquo;slip box.\u0026rdquo; It is both a method of personal knowledge management and a physical (or digital) system you maintain. The method was popularized by German scholar Niklas Luhmann who used it as a \u0026ldquo;conversation partner\u0026rdquo; to help write hundreds of articles and books. To create a Zettelkasten, you need two compartments: literature notes and Zettels. Literature notes are just bibliographic information. Niklas Luhmann wrote the citations of resources on index cards. I keep my references in Zotero. Zettels are what you will see in my digital garden as üå≥ evergreen notes. They are not notes I would take while reading something. Rather, they are insights and my own thoughts what I read or in general. Zettels should be one idea, called an atomic idea. Remember: Niklas Luhmann wrote his Zettels on index cards. Although they are a tidied up atomic idea, they are not immutable.\nAs you write Zettels, you create links between them. The more Zettels you have, and the more links exist between them, the easier it is to see where clusters of ideas form. This is the \u0026ldquo;conversation partner\u0026rdquo; aspect of the Zettelkasten. When clusters form, it shows you what you\u0026rsquo;re interested in and where you have a lot of information already created. From there, you can combine the Zettels and use them to express something larger and more complex.\nYou can learn more Zettelkasten at zettelkasten.de. I also like how Bob Doto explains the Zettelkasten.\n","permalink":"https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/zettelkasten/","summary":"What is a Zettelkasten?
