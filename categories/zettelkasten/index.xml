Instead of using personal knowledge management systems, opera queens are personal information management. They are the tool which captures information.</description></item><item><title>6a2 scrapbooks are a visual, emergent, and generative self-archive of a person's life and memories</title><link>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/6a2-scrapbooks-are-a-visual-emergent-and-generative-self-archive-of-a-persons-life-and-memories/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/6a2-scrapbooks-are-a-visual-emergent-and-generative-self-archive-of-a-persons-life-and-memories/</guid><description>As part of scrapbooking, scrapbookers capture and collect ephemera of the things they do throughout a day, week, month, or other chunk of time. They use scrapbooks to preserve memories. Archives are usually a collection of materials of an institution or person.
Scrapbooks, then, are the archives of a person where they are both the archivist and the person whose materials are being archived.
They have been metaphorically defined as &amp;ldquo;the secretions of an organism&amp;rdquo;, and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity.</description></item><item><title>5b We need an erotics of metadata</title><link>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/5b-we-need-an-erotics-of-metadata/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/5b-we-need-an-erotics-of-metadata/</guid><description>Much of contemporary metadata scholarship focuses on the ethics of descriptive metadata, particularly classification systems. Rightly so. However, like Susan Sontag argues in her essay &amp;ldquo;Against Interpretation,&amp;rdquo; I think the focus on ethics and its effects on end users has become more important than the metadata and the labor of the library worker. Instead of purely focusing on ethics, we if we focused on aesthetics. What insights will the open up about the nature of metadata work?</description></item><item><title>6 Trusting our tools means trusting the people who built those tools</title><link>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/6-trusting-our-tools-means-trusting-the-people-who-built-those-tools/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/6-trusting-our-tools-means-trusting-the-people-who-built-those-tools/</guid><description>Our digital tools and systems, like note-taking apps and search algorithms, are created by people. Our biases and ideologies are built into the tools. John M. Culkin follows this line of thought when giving a brief explanation of The Medium is the Message.
Life imitates art. We shape our tools and thereafter they shape us.1
So, when we trust tools built by other people, we are also trusting their biases and ideologies to shape us and our ideas.</description></item><item><title>6a Using a tool creates a sensual relationship between its user(s) and its creator(s)</title><link>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/6a-using-a-tool-creates-a-sensual-relationship-between-its-users-and-its-creators/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/6a-using-a-tool-creates-a-sensual-relationship-between-its-users-and-its-creators/</guid><description>The aesthetics of a tool can bring us joy, discomfort, peace, or any number of emotional responses. People made the decisions about the user interface, the possible workflows, the graphics and design, etc. with, one would hope, the end-user in mind. These emotional responses happen in the body and have various sensual responses. Culkin, making a pun on message, likens our tools to massages because of how they affect our sensual experience.</description></item><item><title>6a1 The mind is also a tool which we trust and with which we have a sensual relationship</title><link>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/6a1-the-mind-is-also-a-tool-which-we-trust-and-with-which-we-have-a-sensual-relationship/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/6a1-the-mind-is-also-a-tool-which-we-trust-and-with-which-we-have-a-sensual-relationship/</guid><description>Do we count our mind as a tool we created? Or is our mind a creator whom we must trust? Either way, the mind is embodied in our somatic responses to tools. Jon Greenaway explores this fact through the films of [[David Cronenberg]], stressing how the mind is not just embodied but extends beyond the body which contains it. When we trust the creators of tools, we are, at the core, trusting how their minds are embodied in and alter the physical world.</description></item><item><title>5a The aesthetics of information affects our relationships to it</title><link>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/5a-the-aesthetics-of-information-affects-our-relationships-to-it/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/5a-the-aesthetics-of-information-affects-our-relationships-to-it/</guid><description>The visual components of both information and how we interact with information (such as using arrows to draw connections in the quotation below) reinforce the sensual aspect of working with information, knowledge, and metadata. In particular, this person&amp;rsquo;s statement that they make their &amp;ldquo;thoughts hold hands&amp;rdquo; brings a physical and almost erotic element to how they visualize the network of their thinking.

All creative work is inspired by something, draws from something, builds on something.
As Tiago Forte says in the tweet below, creative work is assembled. Philosophically, assemblages are component parts brought together in a way that is fluid (not fixed). Donna Haraway uses the metaphor of [[cyborgs]]1 or &amp;ldquo;making kin&amp;rdquo;2 for assemblages: you bring together things that might not otherwise fit together instead of resolving the tensions between them.</description></item><item><title>5 Metadata work is a sensual experience</title><link>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/5-metadata-work-is-a-sensual-experience/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/5-metadata-work-is-a-sensual-experience/</guid><description>Interacting with information in any capacity triggers sensual responses and resonances in our bodies and minds (which are also our bodies). Metadata workers describe and organize knowledge and information. This requires tuning in to those pleasurable or otherwise sensual reactions as organizing principles.
Iâ€™ve come to think of the body as a computer, taking in more data from more sources than we could ever consciously consider. Our emotions are a vast subterranean intelligence, drawing on not only our senses, but the genetic memories of our ancestors and endless layers of communal thought.</description></item><item><title>1 Archival silence is a problem when its purpose is oppression</title><link>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/1-archival-silence-is-a-problem-when-its-purpose-is-oppression/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/1-archival-silence-is-a-problem-when-its-purpose-is-oppression/</guid><description>Those in power and who hold capital will destroy, distort, and otherwise purposefully not collect information and create metadata about those they wish to silence and remove from any sort of historical record.

There are oral traditions of music transmission, there are Tibetan Buddhist practices that are only shared between lama and student in an unending lineage back to the Buddha, there are traditions where information is only shared within that group.

And in a capitalist society, that data surrogate is more &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; and has more value than we do because it makes them money.

In this case, the &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo; item would be the seed and the surrogate would be what grows and branches out from that original item. The surrogate is a representation of the original item.
In A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari name arborescence or the model of the tree as the paradigm for knowledge and practice in the modern Western world; in this model, a small ideaâ€”a seed or acornâ€”takes root and grows into a tree with a sturdy trunk supporting numerous branches, all linked to and traceable back to the original seed.</description></item><item><title>2a1 Metadata surrogates are the tree trunk instead of the end of a branch</title><link>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/2a1-metadata-surrogates-are-the-tree-trunk-instead-of-the-end-of-a-branch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/2a1-metadata-surrogates-are-the-tree-trunk-instead-of-the-end-of-a-branch/</guid><description>When constructed by others in order to exploit us, the metadata surrogates of ourselves are the seed or original instead of being the thing that grows from and represents the original item.

They are the information object, and they are also what can be said about the information object.
My transsexual body is a catalog, a finding aid, of every testosterone injection I have given myself in my thigh, of the parts of my body I have willingly destroyed to create something better in their wake, of the process of teaching myself to shave my face (which is way different than shaving your legs, it turns out), of the ways my sexuality changed, of the hours of speech and movement therapy I did, of the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m still afraid to use gendered bathrooms in public after 4 years.</description></item></channel></rss>
