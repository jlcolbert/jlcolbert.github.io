David Foster Wallace describes this as an “intellectual adventure.” We don’t restore meaning and patterns, we find them. Our relationship to information can be exploratory and curious.
For me – I mean, a lot of the motivation had to do with, it seems to me, that so much of pre-millennial life in America consists of enormous amounts of what seem like discrete bits of information coming, and that the real kind of intellectual adventure is finding ways to relate them to each other and to find larger patterns and meanings, which of course is essentially narrative, but that structurally it’s a bit different....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2022-07-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 16, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;1 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;jay l. colbert</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 7a Personal knowledge management can come from a state of play" href=https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/7a-personal-knowledge-management-can-come-from-a-state-of-play/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2>1c What is left behind when you remove photos from a scrapbook?</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>During the [[055 - Feminist Scrapbooking]] episode of my podcast [[librarypunk]], we had on feminist scrapbooker Kristin Tweedale to talk about scrapbooking as a mode of information and knowledge management and how to do it in anti-capitalist ways.

They use scrapbooks to preserve memories. Archives are usually a collection of materials of an institution or person.
Scrapbooks, then, are the archives of a person where they are both the archivist and the person whose materials are being archived.
