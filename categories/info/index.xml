cyborgs, but in the assemblages sense

about this site This is a üçÄ digital garden. It contains my notes on various things I&amp;rsquo;m interested in. These notes are at various stages of growth.</description></item><item><title>digital garden</title><link>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/digital-garden/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/digital-garden/</guid><description>What is a digital garden? To quote Maggie Appleton&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;A Brief History &amp;amp; Ethos of the Digital Garden&amp;rdquo;,
They&amp;rsquo;re not following the conventions of the &amp;ldquo;personal blog,&amp;rdquo; as we&amp;rsquo;ve come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.
A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren&amp;rsquo;t strictly organised by their publication date.</description></item><item><title>Zettelkasten</title><link>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/zettelkasten/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/zettelkasten/</guid><description>What is a Zettelkasten? In German, Zettelkasten means &amp;ldquo;slip box.&amp;rdquo; It is both a method of personal knowledge management and a physical (or digital) system you maintain. The method was popularized by German scholar Niklas Luhmann who used it as a &amp;ldquo;conversation partner&amp;rdquo; to help write hundreds of articles and books. To create a Zettelkasten, you need two compartments: literature notes and Zettels. Literature notes are just bibliographic information. Niklas Luhmann wrote the citations of resources on index cards.</description></item></channel></rss>
