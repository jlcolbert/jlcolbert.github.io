Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for coming to my presentation when you could just leave and go outside. My name is Jay L. Colbert, and today I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting &amp;ldquo;Describing Absence: The Complicated Power of Metadata Surrogates in Libraries &amp;amp; Archives&amp;rdquo;
Advanced notice that this presentation will mention suicide and potentially upsetting language.</description></item><item><title>Obligatory "I Took the Building a Second Brain Course" Post</title><link>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/obligatory-i-took-the-building-a-second-brain-course-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilde-at-heart.garden/pages/obligatory-i-took-the-building-a-second-brain-course-post/</guid><description>Every time I search a note-taking tool online, I inevitably see it: &amp;ldquo;Using insert-tool-here to build my second brain&amp;rdquo; or some variation on that theme. The video or blog post will always go over the basics of what a second brain is, and it usually mentions that the person took Tiago Forte&amp;rsquo;s Building a Second Brain course.
So I guess it&amp;rsquo;s my turn.
What is Building a Second Brain Building a Second Brain is a methodology, online course, and (as of writing this post) forthcoming book by Tiago Forte.</description></item></channel></rss>
