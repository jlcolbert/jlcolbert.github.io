Our digital tools and systems, like note-taking apps and search algorithms, are created by people. Our biases and ideologies are built into the tools. John M. Culkin follows this line of thought when giving a brief explanation of *The Medium is the Message.*

> Life imitates art. We shape our tools and thereafter they shape us.[^1]

So, when we trust tools built by other people, we are also trusting their biases and ideologies to shape us and our ideas.
