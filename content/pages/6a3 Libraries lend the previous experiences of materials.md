The [[189 - Library Socialism & Usufruct]] episode of the [[Srsly Wrong]] podcast mentions that writing in library books is not defacing or destroying them; rather, "value" is added because the library lends out the thoughts and scribbles of everyone who had that book before.

Even if an item hasn't been scribbled in, the library, in theory, is still lending that item with its entire history of having been used and enjoyed by others. Non-destructive use imbues *all* library materials with history and experience, and that gets both passed down and added to with each loan.
