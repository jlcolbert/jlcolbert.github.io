During the [[055 - Feminist Scrapbooking]] episode of my podcast [[librarypunk]], we had on feminist scrapbooker Kristin Tweedale to talk about scrapbooking as a mode of information and knowledge management and how to do it in anti-capitalist ways.

One of us (I'm blanking on who) mentioned someone in the family having a scrapbook with all the pictures removed. Not only was the scrapbook empty, but it had once been full of photos that were no longer there.

In thinking of embodiment and archival silence, is this an instance of potential silence? I want to encourage thinking, regardless of your answer to that question, that new information is created in the act of removal; the absence itself has meaning.
