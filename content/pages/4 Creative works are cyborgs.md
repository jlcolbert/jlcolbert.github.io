Nothing we make is truly original. All creative work is inspired by something, draws from something, builds on something.

As Tiago Forte says in the tweet below, creative work is _assembled_. Philosophically, assemblages are component parts brought together in a way that is fluid (not fixed). Donna Haraway uses the metaphor of [[cyborgs]][^1] or "making kin"[^2] for assemblages: you bring together things that might not otherwise fit together instead of resolving the tensions between them.

Therefore, when we create something, we are assembling a cyborg rather than reinforcing the boundaries of our inspirations and our ideas.

> Assemblage (from French: agencement, "a collection of things which have been gathered together or assembled") is a concept developed by Gilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari, originally presented in their book A Thousand Plateaus (1980). Assemblage theory frames social complexity in the emphasis of fluidity, exchangeability, and the multiple functions through entities that create their connectivity. Assemblage theory asserts that, within a body, the relationships of component parts are not stable and fixed; rather, they can be displaced and replaced within and among other bodies, thus approaching systems through relations of exteriority.

- To acknowledge this is to acknowledge the [[rhizomatic]] nature of knowledge and creativity. Are our creative works also surrogates: [2a Metadata surrogates are inherently arborescent]({{< ref "2a Metadata surrogates are inherently arborescent" >}}). If so, would that make them also arborescent *and* rhizomatic, or just one or the other?
