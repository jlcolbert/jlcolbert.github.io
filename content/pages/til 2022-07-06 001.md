Zotero is usually pretty good at recognizing the format of something you save via the browser extension. I've noticed it doesn't pick up podcasts, even though that's a format you can cite.

However! If you have the Zotero iPhone app, you can use the "share" function in your podcast app (Spotify, at least; I haven't tested others) and send it to Zotero. It recognizes it as a podcast when done that way.
