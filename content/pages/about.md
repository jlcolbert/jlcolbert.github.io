### about this site

this is a 🍀 [digital garden]({{< ref "digital garden" >}}). it contains my notes on various things i'm interested in. these notes are at various stages of growth. when they reach a certain stage of maturity, i make them evergreen and put them in my 🗃 [Zettelkasten]({{< ref "Zettelkasten" >}}).

### colophon

i write all the content of this site in Logseq and build it via the static site generator Hugo. i use the logseq-schrodinger plugin to convert the pages to Hugo-compatible Markdown. finally, i use the logseq-hugo-template to structure everything and provide the theme.
