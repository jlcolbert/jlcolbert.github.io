### about me

My name is jay, and I'm a librarian. I'm passionate about knowledge management and organization, personal or otherwise, and I'm a nerd for anything hypertext. I also love opera and my two pets: my cat King Arthur and my bearded dragon coop.

### about this site

This is a 🍀 [digital garden]({{< ref "digital garden" >}}). It contains my notes on various things I'm interested in. These notes are at various stages of growth. When they reach a certain level of maturity, I make them 🌳 evergreen and put them in my 🗃 [Zettelkasten]({{< ref "Zettelkasten" >}}).

### colophon

I write all the content of this site in [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) and build it via the static site generator Hugo. I use the [logseq-schrodinger](https://github.com/sawhney17/logseq-schrodinger) plugin to convert the pages to Hugo-compatible Markdown. Finally, I use the [Logseq-Hugo-Template](https://github.com/CharlesChiuGit/Logseq-Hugo-Template) to structure everything, provide the theme, and push it to GitHub Pages.
