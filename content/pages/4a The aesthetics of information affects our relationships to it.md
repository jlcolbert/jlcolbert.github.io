The visual components of both information and how we interact with information (such as using arrows to draw connections in the quotation below) reinforce the sensual aspect of working with information, knowledge, and metadata.
In particular, this person's statement that they make their "thoughts hold hands" brings a physical and almost erotic element to how they visualize the network of their thinking.

> i love arrows -> and drawing connections -> noticing patterns -> making my thoughts hold hands ->[^1]

- A purpose of [personal knowledge management]({{< ref "personal knowledge management" >}}) systems[^2] is to externalize the information we interact and create instead of keeping it all in our heads. For people with ADHD, this is doubly important because our working memories are not that great. How is this externalization heightened when it is given a body and autonomy. See [3 My transsexual body is a metadata record]({{< ref "3 My transsexual body is a metadata record" >}}).

- Furthermore, does this physical externalizing make a cyborg of us and information? [3 Creative works are cyborgs]({{< ref "3 Creative works are cyborgs" >}}).
