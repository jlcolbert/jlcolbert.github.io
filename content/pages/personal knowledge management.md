*â€”Carrie Ben-Ysrael*

When we have control over how we relate to information and knowledge, that can be a radical act.

When others control our relationship to information, it shapes our reality in ways we might not notice. It also affects how we construct the social identities of ourselves and others.[^1]

[^1]: The Bad Gays podcast often shows this phenomenon; [the episode on Anne Bonny comes to mind](https://badgayspod.com/episode-archive/s5e5-anne-bonny).
