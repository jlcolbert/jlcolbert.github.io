### what is a digital garden?

to quote [Maggie Appleton's "A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden"](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history),

> *They're not following the conventions of the "personal blog," as we've come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.*
> 
> *A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.*

a digital garden allows me to find connections between my thoughts and the things i'm interested in. i tend to my garden when i can. i can also see how my ideas grow over time. because i make it public, you can also witness all this. this is called [[learning in public]].

### stages of growth

it is important to note that, during the growth process, all notes remain atomic.

- ðŸŒ± *seedling* notes aren't quite the very start of an idea, but the note has enough in it that i can link it to other things and have it make sense to people who aren't me (otherwise i wouldn't make it public)

- ðŸŒ¿ *budding* notes are cleaned up and have gone through a bit of distillation; maybe i've linked more things to them

- ðŸŒ³ *evergreen* notes are at a stage when i can move them into my ðŸ—ƒ [Zettelkasten]({{< ref "Zettelkasten" >}}); they are mature enough to serve as building blocks for things i might write or otherwise express.

### digital garden terms of service

because a digital garden exposes my ideas to the world, it puts me in a vulnerable position. therefore, i ask that you follow the [Digital Garden Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos), and i promise to do the same.
