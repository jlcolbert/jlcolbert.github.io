They use scrapbooks to preserve memories. Archives are usually a collection of materials of an institution or person.
Scrapbooks, then, are the archives of a person where they are both the archivist and the person whose materials are being archived.
They have been metaphorically defined as &amp;ldquo;the secretions of an organism&amp;rdquo;, and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity.</description></item></channel></rss>
